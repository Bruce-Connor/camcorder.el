* screencast.el

Tool for capturing screencasts directly from Emacs.

- To use it, simply call =M-x screencast-record=.
- When you're finished, hit =F12=.

Screencasts can be generated in any format understood by
=imagemagick='s =convert= command. 
You can even pause the recording with =F11=!

** Dependencies

=screencast.el= uses the [[https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/names/][*Names*]] package, so if you're installing
manually you need to install that too.

For the recording, =screencast.el= uses the following linux utilities.
If you have these, it should work out of the box. If you use something
else, you should still be able to configure =screencast.el= work.

- recordmydesktop
- mplayer
- imagemagick
